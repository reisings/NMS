Network Management Scripts\n
The junos_grab.py script is based on pexpect and works great but uses hard coded commands
The junos_gcl.py script is based off of junos_grab.py but has the capability for many IPs to Many commands from a file.\n
The grab_junos.py script is based pn paramiko. It has a lot of features but it is throwing an exception issue
when I jump across a wireless router and i'm not sure how to fix it at this point. Anyone knows how please let me know.\n
All of the scripts log IP_DATE.txt
